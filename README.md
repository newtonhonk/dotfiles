# Dotfiles for Fedora Linux (mainly Sway)

**DISCLAMER**: Just a bunch of config files for my personal sway setup with Fedora Linux (currently 39). Use at unkown risk.
I copied a lot of stuff from the internet:
- openSUSE tumbleweed sway config (https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:OpenSUSEway)
- Learn Linux TV (https://www.learnlinux.tv/how-i-set-up-the-sway-window-manager-on-debian-12/)
- Smyck Color Scheme (https://color.smyck.org/)
- In case, that I forgot someone ... just say it :)
