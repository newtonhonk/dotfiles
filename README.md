# Dotfiles for Fedora Linux (mainly Sway)

### Disclaimer:
Just a bunch of config files for my personal sway setup with Fedora Linux (currently 39). **Use at unkown risk!**
I copied a lot of stuff from the internet:
- openSUSE tumbleweed sway config (https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:OpenSUSEway)
- Learn Linux TV (https://www.learnlinux.tv/how-i-set-up-the-sway-window-manager-on-debian-12/)
- Smyck Color Scheme (https://color.smyck.org/)
- In case, that I forgot someone ... just say it :)

### Notes:
- This config is mainly for Fedora 39 running a on TUXEDO Pulse 14 Gen3 Version 1.0
- The screenmode is currently set to 2880x1800@96.011Hz, because at 120Hz I have flickering in Firefox and Thunderbird
- Adaptive Sync is on
